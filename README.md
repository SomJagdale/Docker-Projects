## this is main branch
Docker bootcamp Scaler 

Problem of existing system
 - Dependency Libs and versions
 - Resource Utilisation 
 - Isolation 
 - Scallablity 


Solution - VM and Containers  
  - Portablity 
  - Os Independent 
  - Dependency Packaging 
  - No need to re-install everything, just docker 
  - Enviroment isolation 

Important Terms
Images 
 - A template used to build Container 
 - Similer to snapshot of in a VM
 - It contains application and dependent libraries and envirnonment 

Containers
 -  A Run time instance of Contaner Image 

Docker file 
 - Contains commands to requred to assemble the an image
 - You can build images from this
 - COntains details of app and dependent libs and base image


Docker Hub 
 - Place to store your images 
 - To share those to world 

Daemon 
 -  Listne to events from the manager 


Registry 
 -  Stateless, highly scalable server 
 -  It stores and distribute docker images 
 -  Used privately 


Docker features 
 -  Re-use
 -  Shred library 
 -  Dependancy Managment 
 -  OS independent 
    Can work with window mac linux (but under the surface mac use linux hyperwiser and windows uses linux subsystem)
 -  Scalable 
 -  Flexible 
 -  Versioning
 -  Secure 
 
 But Why really???? Docker 
  - Cost Effective - Saves Money 
  - Granular updates - Saves Time
  - Speed of deployment - Save more time and happy client s
  - Smaller devops staff

VM VS Docker 
Minutes - Second 
Single Instance - Single Instance for all container 
Own Kernal - Shared Kernal
Security - Less Security (Not own kernel)


Docker Lingo
 - prune(Delete all stopped containers, all used and dangling images) 
 - unused 
 - dangling (A new image is created so old one is now usless)
 - sandbox 
 - client 
 - pull and push 
 
 Volumes 
  - Preferred mechanism for perstistance data generated by docker containers 
  - Different from bind mounts, these are completley managed by docker 

Networks 
  -  Link multiple docker container together
  -  A single contaienr can be part of multiple networks 
  -  Brigdes private default network created 

Services 
  - Run multiple container volumes network together
